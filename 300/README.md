# 300 - Building Our Application

## 100 - Get Started Now

Open your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Repository in Gitpod workspace, then you just need to install **Sourcegraph Cody VS Code Extension** and you are good to go!

## 200 - Working Demo

We’ll be using [openfga/openfga repository](https://github.com/openfga/openfga) for the demo. 

It wasn’t indexed, primarily, and you can quickly index any Public Repository via their discord & So do we. 

You would need to quickly index any public repository via Sourcegraph’s Discord.

### 100 - Understanding the Repository & Codebase

The first question we asked Cody is the TLDR for this repository:

Prompt Cody:

```
Give me a TLDR for this openFGA repository
```

Response from Cody.

```
... left out for time-sake
```

As I’m new to this repository, I wanted to explore how it actually works. How do their check systems work? Where can I find some related code occurrences for that?

Prompt Cody:

```
How does the resource access check services in this project & where can I find the code related to it?
```

Response from Cody.

```
... left out for time-sake
```

Prompt Cody:

```
How does check resource service works? Show me some code occurrences.
```

Once it returned the files suggested, I wanted to know more about specific functions in the code. Cody helped return some high-level descriptions of the code!

Prompt Cody:

```
Explain selected code (high level).
```
